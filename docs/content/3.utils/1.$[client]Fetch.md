Cliens are generated for each OpenAPI client specified in the `openFetch` section of Nuxt config and provide a convenient wrapper around `$fetch`. 

You can access clients from the Vue context using `useNuxtApp()`.

It has the same API as Nuxt's [$fetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/dollarfetch) util with additional `path` option, which is used to replace params in the pathname.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { $petsFetch } = useNuxtApp()

const data = await $petsFetch('/pet/{petId}', {
  path: {
    petId: 12
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ data?.name }}</h1>
</template>
```
